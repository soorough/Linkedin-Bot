LinkedIn Easy Apply Bot

Automate your job applications on LinkedIn with this Python bot that applies to job listings with one-click "Easy Apply" options. The bot logs into your LinkedIn profile, performs a job search based on specified keywords and location, filters the results to show only "Easy Apply" jobs, and then proceeds to apply to each of these job listings automatically.

Features:
- Easy setup with a configuration file (config.json)
- Automatic login to your LinkedIn profile
- Customizable search with keywords and location
- Filter jobs to show only "Easy Apply" listings

note - It only applies to "Easy Apply" jobs not every single one

Usage:
1. Clone the repository and install the required dependencies and you will also need a chrome-driver to run this with your suitable browser.
2. Fill in your LinkedIn login credentials and job search preferences in the config.json file.
3. Run the main.py script to start the bot.
4. Sit back and relax while the bot applies to relevant job listings on your behalf.

Please note:
- Use this bot responsibly and follow LinkedIn's terms of service.
- The bot is designed for educational and personal use only and should not be used for commercial purposes or spamming.
- LinkedIn may change its website structure or policies, which could affect the bot's functionality. Use at your own risk.

Contributions and feedback are welcome! Feel free to fork the project, make improvements, and submit pull requests.

Happy job hunting with LinkedIn Easy Apply Bot!
