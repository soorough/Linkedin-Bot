LinkedIn Easy Apply Bot

Automate your job applications on LinkedIn with this Python bot that applies to job listings. The bot logs into your LinkedIn profile, performs a job search based on specified keywords and location, filters the results, and then proceeds to apply to each of these job listings automatically.

Features:
- Easy setup with a configuration file (config.json)
- Automatic login to your LinkedIn profile
- Customizable search with keywords and location

note - It only applies to "Easy Apply" jobs not every single one.

Prerequisites:
1. Your resume should be saved in your linkedin account.
2. You should have applied to some of the jobs manually i.e. it would help bot to save your preferences about basic questions asked for the job and would not throw error.
3. Make sure you have python installed.

How to Use:(IMPORTANT)
1. Clone the repository and install the required "dependencies" and you will also need a "chrome-driver" to run this with your suitable browser. You can download it using the following link: https://googlechromelabs.github.io/chrome-for-testing/  (check your chrome browser version before in the about section).
2. Fill in your LinkedIn login credentials and job search preferences in the config.json file.
3. Run the main.py script to start the bot.
4. Sit back and relax while the bot applies to relevant job listings on your behalf.

Please note:
- Use this bot responsibly and follow LinkedIn's terms of service.
- The bot is designed for educational and personal use only and should not be used for commercial purposes or spamming.
- LinkedIn may change its website structure or policies, which could affect the bot's functionality. Use at your own risk.
